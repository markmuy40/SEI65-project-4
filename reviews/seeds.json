    "Title": "Alpkit Koala Bikepacking Seat Bag",
    "Price": "£60",
    "Description": "Bag build and packing\\r\\nThe bag is made from VX21, a four-layer, 210 denier fabric with a durable water repellent (DWR) finish; it's a popular choice, widely used on similar styles of bags. Given the bag's position, it's highly likely to get wet from the rear wheel so weatherproofing is vital, and throughout use the contents stayed completely dry. It's not claimed to be fully waterproof, so I'd still suggest you pack anything electronic, or anything that could be damaged by water, within a dry-bag.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Koala uses a roll-top closure with two buckles, one for holding it closed and the other to tension the contents. This is very useful when packing items such as a light sleeping bag or down jacket – items that can be compressed to reduce overall space. While it may not be a design intention, the compression strap is also a possible location for a rear light, depending on the light's fitting.",

    "Title": "Restrap Bar Bag Small review – versatile bag and holster bikepacking combo",
    "Price": "£100",
    "Description": "The big advantage of the holster and dry bag design system is that once the holster is strapped securely onto the bars you can remove and refit the dry bag really easily. That’s a major plus compared to trying to pull things out of the ends with the bars in the way, or having to unmount the entire bag. The holster also does a decent job of protecting the lightweight dry bag too - from above and behind at least. It also keeps the whole set up stable and gives you a firm base for the bungee (and the Food Pouch if you go ‘Large’). \\r\\n\\r\\nThe downside is that the chunky ‘holster’ with its heavyweight straps weighs more than some complete lightweight bag bag set ups. You also need to line up the slightly saggy dry bag carefully to stop it getting lopsided and getting too close to the bars even on a relatively broad, flared bar.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the spaced, below the bars set up means you still get a full set of hand positions it also adds depth to the whole set up. Restrap themselves recommend at least 230mm of clearance between bar and tire and that’s not going to be possible with some smaller bikes. Obviously you could remove the spacers and cinch it right up to the bars if needs be though. While the holster straps that hold the dry bag have tidy tabs, there aren’t any on the fork crown straps. That means you’ll need to be careful to tuck loose ends out of the way of the wheels. They also add another area where the paint will need protecting from wear. Alternatively you can use the cunning new Restrap Bumper Bar that slides under the stem as a more solid secondary mount/paint protector.",

    "Price": "£96",
    "Description": "I’ve been using the Revelate Designs Tangle Frame Bag for over a year on all of my bikes and consider it essential for bikepacking trips and everyday training rides. The Tangle uses space on my frame that would otherwise go to waste and provides super handy access to items, like food and gels, while I’m riding. For bikepacking, the Tangle also provides a convenient place to store tent poles or tent stakes where they won’t get in the way. I also use panniers on my gravel and fat tire bike to hold the bulk of my camping gear. If you’re trying to decide between bikepacking bags or panniers, I’d encourage you to consider a mixed approach. See Bikepacking Bags vs Panniers: How to Choose.",

    "Description": "The Wildcat Tiger Drover Saddle Harness is designed to hold a drybag securely beneath your saddle, and makes for an incredibly secure and lightweight bikepacking setup. The design makes packing easy and quick, although the initial setup can take a while.\n\nTester Matt writes: “With everything installed, the overwhelming impression is how secure the bag is – there's virtually no side to side movement. Even when riding and purposefully trying to initiate some sway, it stays completely solid.\n\n“With regular saddlepacks I usually remove the whole bag from the bike to pack effectively, but being able to leave the harness in place really speeds things up. Packing can be several minutes faster.\n\n“When bikepacking there is little more frustrating than a saddle bag that is constantly swaying, and the Wildcat Tiger Drover Saddle Harness has that completely under control. It's a system that works well, makes packing easier and makes for a usefully faster getaway too.”",

    "Price": "£46",
    "Description": "I was impressed by how stable the bag is, with little or no movement even on gravel rides. There wasn't even any real need for the security cord that goes around the head tube; it was stable anyway. With its 3-litre capacity, there's room inside for all sorts of bits and bobs such as tools, snacks and low-bulk extra layers. There's nothing in the way of internal pockets, and with the stiffener in place, the inside of the bag is a pretty slippery place, so things tend to rattle and bounce about a bit. I generally either made sure the contents were wrapped inside something to stop them rattling, or that the bag was fairly full of mixed soft and hard items.\n\n“Given the quality of the build and materials, and its UK boutique pedigree, the Blimp 2.0 is hard to fault for £40. Pick a colour, any colour and support a small independent UK business in the process. It's well made, well designed and great value for money.”",

With no zippers to fail, the 52Hz should be much more durable in the long term, and it also gains 100% waterproofing.\n\nAlthough we did find zippered frame bags quicker to access, the roll-top opening on the 52Hz meant that we were able to pack it quite a bit fuller, as we didn’t have to worry about getting the zip closed, and when heavily loaded it was easier to manage.\n\nThe 52Hz is extremely well made and comes in different styles and sizes to suit a variety of bike types. For those heading out on day rides, this might not be the bag we’d choose, but for bikepackers looking for a frame bag that should last for years to come, the 52Hz would be our pick.",

    "Description": "With a simple yet highly effective design, the Topeak MidLoader is a fantastic budget frame bag that punches far above its price point.\n\nAvailable in three different sizes and with a simple, half-frame design, the MidLoader should fit well with most bicycles. Like the more expensive Apidura Expedition Frame Pack, the MidLoader takes up the top half of the frame and should allow access to water bottle cages.\n\nIt’s burly and durable, so it should stand up to long-term abuse well, and the simple design makes it very convenient to use. The material is water-resistant rather than waterproof, so we’d suggest being careful about what you store inside this bag or using something like a ziplock bag or dry sack to keep valuables dry.\n\nThe MidLoader is heavier than comparatively sized bags, although the thicker material might also last longer. All in all, this is an excellent frame bag that should work just as well on a road bike as a hardtail, making it an outstanding and highly versatile product.",
