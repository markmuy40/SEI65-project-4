    "Price": "£60",
    "Description": "Bag build and packing\\r\\nThe bag is made from VX21, a four-layer, 210 denier fabric with a durable water repellent (DWR) finish; it's a popular choice, widely used on similar styles of bags. Given the bag's position, it's highly likely to get wet from the rear wheel so weatherproofing is vital, and throughout use the contents stayed completely dry. It's not claimed to be fully waterproof, so I'd still suggest you pack anything electronic, or anything that could be damaged by water, within a dry-bag.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Koala uses a roll-top closure with two buckles, one for holding it closed and the other to tension the contents. This is very useful when packing items such as a light sleeping bag or down jacket – items that can be compressed to reduce overall space. While it may not be a design intention, the compression strap is also a possible location for a rear light, depending on the light's fitting.",

    "Title": "Restrap Bar Bag Small review – versatile bag and holster bikepacking combo",
    "Price": "£100",
    "Description": "The big advantage of the holster and dry bag design system is that once the holster is strapped securely onto the bars you can remove and refit the dry bag really easily. That’s a major plus compared to trying to pull things out of the ends with the bars in the way, or having to unmount the entire bag. The holster also does a decent job of protecting the lightweight dry bag too - from above and behind at least. It also keeps the whole set up stable and gives you a firm base for the bungee (and the Food Pouch if you go ‘Large’). \\r\\n\\r\\nThe downside is that the chunky ‘holster’ with its heavyweight straps weighs more than some complete lightweight bag bag set ups. You also need to line up the slightly saggy dry bag carefully to stop it getting lopsided and getting too close to the bars even on a relatively broad, flared bar.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the spaced, below the bars set up means you still get a full set of hand positions it also adds depth to the whole set up. Restrap themselves recommend at least 230mm of clearance between bar and tire and that’s not going to be possible with some smaller bikes. Obviously you could remove the spacers and cinch it right up to the bars if needs be though. While the holster straps that hold the dry bag have tidy tabs, there aren’t any on the fork crown straps. That means you’ll need to be careful to tuck loose ends out of the way of the wheels. They also add another area where the paint will need protecting from wear. Alternatively you can use the cunning new Restrap Bumper Bar that slides under the stem as a more solid secondary mount/paint protector.",

    "Title": "Revelate Designs Tangle Bikepacking Frame Bag Review",
    "Price": "£96",
    "Description": "I’ve been using the Revelate Designs Tangle Frame Bag for over a year on all of my bikes and consider it essential for bikepacking trips and everyday training rides. The Tangle uses space on my frame that would otherwise go to waste and provides super handy access to items, like food and gels, while I’m riding. For bikepacking, the Tangle also provides a convenient place to store tent poles or tent stakes where they won’t get in the way. I also use panniers on my gravel and fat tire bike to hold the bulk of my camping gear. If you’re trying to decide between bikepacking bags or panniers, I’d encourage you to consider a mixed approach. See Bikepacking Bags vs Panniers: How to Choose.",
